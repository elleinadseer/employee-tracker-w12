## Development

This project went relatively smoothly aside from the initial difficulties I had in having the tests run successfully - this issue ended up being as simple as the prompt names not aligning with the generateSVG function. It was difficult to derive where the origin of this issue lay, for a long time I believed it was an issue in the testing code so I was surprised to discover it was a prompt issue. I hope in the future I can discover better means of narrowing down the location of an error.

## Credits

I have heavily relied on information taught through the module 12 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs.
