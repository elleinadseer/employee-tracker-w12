## Description

I have been tasked to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL. I also utilises promises and asynchronous code in the code. The MySQL databases utilises some complexities such as primary keys in order to link ID's between tables.

## Development

This project was lengthy in terms of writing the code but the concepts were not too difficult. When finishing up the code I ran into errors but the error codes using MySQL were generous and I was able to locate the errors based on these messages. Something I ran into was when I wrote ".prompt" this would autocorrect to another coding term so I'm concerned about this in future and need to find a way to disable this so my prompts aren't auto-corrected into failing code.

## Credits

I have heavily relied on information taught through the module 12 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs.
